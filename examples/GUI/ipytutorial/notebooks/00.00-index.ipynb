    "# Acknowledgements\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Special thanks to the dozens of [ipywidgets developers](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets/graphs/contributors), including Jonathan Frederic, who wrote much of the code in the early years of ipywidgets, Sylvain Corlay, who kept the project going at a critical time, and Jason Grout, who currently leads the project and has nurtured the growth of the widget ecosystem.\n",
    "+ Several of the notebooks in this tutorial were originally developed as part of [ipywidgets](http://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) by Brian E. Granger ([@ellisonbg](https://github.com/ellisonbg)) and Jonathan Frederic ([@jdfreder](https://github.com/jdfreder)).\n",
    "+ Thanks to Doug Redden ([@DougRzz](https://github.com/DougRzz))\n",
    "+ Project Jupyter core developer Carol Willing ([@willingc](https://github.com/willingc)) and [Minnesota State University Moorhead](http://physics.mnstate.edu) students Andrew Block ([@ACBlock](https://github.com/ACBlock)) and Jane Glanzer ([@janeglanzer](https://github.com/janeglanzer)) provided very useful feedback on early drafts of this tutorial.\n",
    "+ Thanks to [Jason Grout](https://github.com/jasongrout), [Sylvain Corlay](https://github.com/SylvainCorlay) and [Maarten Breddels](https://github.com/maartenbreddels) who also contributed to these tutorial Notebooks."
