      " |  from an empty list.\n",
      " |  \n",
      " |  An AtomGroup can be indexed and sliced like a list::\n",
      " |  \n",
      " |     ag[0], ag[-1]\n",
      " |  \n",
      " |  will return the first and the last :class:`Atom` in the group\n",

      " |  \n",
      " |     ag[0:6:2]\n",
      " |  \n",
      " |  returns every second element, corresponding to indices 0, 2, and 4.\n",
      " |  \n",
      " |  It also supports \"advanced slicing\" when the argument is a\n",
      " |  :class:`numpy.ndarray` or a :class:`list`::\n",

      " |  \n",

      " |  \n",
      " |     The name-attribute instant selector access to atoms is mainly\n",
